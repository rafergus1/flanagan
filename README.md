To run in debug from Visual Studio code, you will need to build first so it
generates the node_modules folder.  This is a big folder and we don't want to 
deploy it to the web server so we don't commit in the repo.<br>
`>> npm install --save dotenv`


Then you need to run command node . to start the server.
Then you can go to 127.0.0.1:3000 to see the page. <br>
`>> node .`
